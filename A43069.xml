         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

State: for wee have had too much experience of what hath followed the practices and plots of the adverſaries and enemies of the ſame; by which meanes we have not been permitted any time to take into conſideration the abuſes in the worſhip of God in our Religion, and the manifold grievances of the Subiect, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and iniuries of perſons as well ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall as temporall in places of authority in Church and Stare; but now many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the bleſſing of God, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the King and his high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, are removed and avoided, that did much hinder our proceedings therein, by which we have now againe ſome time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what buſineſſe wee had in hand before theſe diſtractions and diſtempers of the State were raiſed, and to proceed in the ſame.</p>

               <lb/>
This Bill againſt plurality of Benefices, will bee a meanes to purge the Clergy from much vice and impuritie, eaſe, plenty and ſaciety bred in many idleneſſe and luxury; men gave themſelves over wholly to the world, to minde earthly things, and that which ought to be agreeable to their function, they altogether neglected, nay contemned and deſpiſed, as a thing not worthy of their ſtudy and paines, the ſound and pure preaching of

But as farre unfit to execute his office as a Teacher over thoſe committed to his charge, as almoſt Plow-men to bee Biſhops: This increaſed vice, impaired vertue; by theſe was it no hard matter for the ſuperiours to introduce into Church ſuperſtitious Ceremonies; theſe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be drawne to preach liberty and vices, rather then teach piety and godlineſſe; no hard matter at leaſt to bring them to that paſſe they may be at any time ready to chuſe what religion to be of, according as the times alter.</p>

This Bill will (I hope) prove a great means to reſtrain their licentious and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirits, if likewiſe there might bee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bill for the explanation of this, enacting thereby no perſon of what degree or dignity ſoever, may preſent any Incumbent to any Benifice, till his life and converſation, his learning and ability bee well knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: That no Popiſh Lords, or diſaffected Prelates may have no longer the preſentation to Benefices; but all preſentations may bee committed to the diſpoſall of ſuch as the Parliament in their wiſedome ſhall thinke fit to be intruſted with the ſame: That all ſuch as have Benefices of great value, may allow out of the ſame to his neighboring Miniſters whoſe places will not yeeld them a competent Maintenance for themſelves and Families, That ſuch as are in great Benefices, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcharge his duty in his place, may be inioyned to allow a ſufficient competency to his hireling or under Curate, whereby the Cure may be faithfully and diligently ſerved, That all men of the Miniſtery may be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to place according to their worth in their Learning and piety, that men of moſt vertue may bee planted in the beſt Benefices, That by this meanes, they may ſtrive (as before by vice) ſo now by vertue, to raiſe their fortunes by the Miniſtery.</p>
